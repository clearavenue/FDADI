Brief description 
Our team followed best practices set forth in the U.S. Digital Services Playbook and has included evidence as required by this Request For Quotation (RFQ) in our repository.
1. clearAvenue Agile Tech Specs, 2. clearAvenue Agile Development Practices 3. Wireframes 4. Usability Survey Questionnaire 5. Usability design

a. Our team assigned Dr. Srini Kankanahalli as our leader. As Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of clearAvenue, Dr. Kankanahalli has full authority to authorize required resources to develop the myMedications Application. Additionally, Dr. Kankanahalli, a certified scrum master, is directly responsible for assuring the quality of the prototype delivered for this RFQ.
b. In order to develop the prototype requested, our company assembled a team of competent professionals for many of the labor categories (WE NEED MIN 2 FOR STACK 2 AND MIN 5 FOR STACK 3). Our team was comprised of the following: Category 1 - Dr. Srini Kankanahalli, Category 2 - Gopal Kankanahalli, Category 3 - Samantha Brooks, Category 4 - Tina Byers, Category 5 - Logan Smith, Category 6 - Timothy Scott, Category 7 - Gregory Noyes, Category 8 - Jeff Heath, Category 9 - Jeff Heath (Same as 8?), Category 10 - Nelofur Damiani, Category 11 - William Hunt, Category 12 - Jennifer Katz, Category 13 - Christina Paleczka
c. When developing the Application, we utilized modern, open source technologies including: 1. Bootstrap, 2. jQuery, 3. Apache Tomcat, 4. MongoDB, 5. Morphia, 6. JUnit, 7. FindBugs, 8. Spring Web model-view-controller (MVC) framework, 9. Apache Selenium, 10. Nagios, 11. Eclipse, 12.Java, 13. Apache Maven, and 14.Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J). 
d. Our Application was deployed on (Iaas) using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. For additional details: clearAvenue Agile development Approach for myMedications App development Section XX.
e. When developing our code, all code was thoroughly unit tested prior to integration into the application. Our unit test scripts were created from our functional requirements which were User Stories captured in JIRA. Each user stories also had relevant acceptance criteria which were used to create our test cases.
f. We used Bamboo Continuous Integration Server and integrated Maven Build and Deploy Scripts for build as well as DevOPS. The Maven Build scripts also included automated testing through integrated Junit, Apache Selenium as well as Findbugs and Clover tests for static analysis and code coverage. The code was continuously deployed on Iaas using AWS.
g. When developing myMedications, we implemented Configuration Management (CM) tools (EXAMPLES?) to control versions of software and documentation. We used the Git repository for configuration management for all software and documentation.
h. When deploying myMedications, we utilized Continuous Monitoring using Amazon Web Services monitoring for Infrastructure and Nagios for Application and Database level continuous monitoring.
i. We deployed software in the Docker container in the AWS Instance.
j. We followed Agile/Scrum processes which were divided into 7 sprints to develop software using an iterative approach. At the completion of each sprint, feedback was solicited from users in order to add features, report bugs, correct software defects, and provide feature enhancements. For additional details: clearAvenue Agile development Approach for myMedications App development.
k. We developed an Install Guide to create step-by-step instructions for future deployments on the process of creating and running the prototype of other machines. For additional details: myMedications Application Installation Instructions.
l. Our prototype and platforms utilize open source which are available for no cost to anyone who wishes to utilize the application.
